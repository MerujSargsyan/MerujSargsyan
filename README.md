I am an imigrant from Armenia who is working hard to achieve greatness. I am currently a <b> senior student at UCSD </b> with a GPA of <b> ~3.6 </b>
I enjoy programming recreationally, meaning that I creat eprojects I am interested in and although I may not finish most of them, I always learn a lot
through this process. Additionally, I like video games and have played chess professionally.

### Education: UCSD 2022 - 2025, Math/Computer Science

### Currently Learning: raylib game library <img src="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/logo/raylib_1024x1024.png" alt="Raylib icon" width="50" />

By using this library I have found that it is very intuitive and light in it's contents. Using this library, I have created multiple interest projects such as a
game of life simulator, and I am currently working on a role playing game inspired by my favorite story of all time: <b> Re:Zero </b>
